There's an old saying: you'll go fast alone, but you'll go <ColorEmphasis>**very far**</ColorEmphasis> together. Learning
will be much more consistent and productive in a community than on your own, getting a job will be a much less daunting
endeavor, and it takes two or more to build something great.

In this lesson, let's learn how to grow the power of community and friends and use it to overcome any challenges in your
way of getting a job.

We will be solely focusing on our professional life in this lesson, but most likely, you'll make awesome lifelong friends
that go way beyond jobs. üòÑ


## Junior Job Woes

<ServerImage alt={"A folk who discovered why it is so hard to gain a job in tech"} slug={"/01/05/entry-level-job.png"}/>

What you're looking at is a fellow who already has a job in the tech industry finding out why it's
<ColorEmphasis color="#FF4444">**hard**</ColorEmphasis> to find work in tech.

Turns out that the company only interviewed people who have been *referred*, and their manager put the rest *on the
back burner* and didn't even look at most of the resumes!

Basically, just clicking apply on LinkedIn and submitting your resume could be even worse than throwing your
CV/resume off the window, then having someone else pick it lying around on the street by chance and then refer you to a job.

One of their candidates didn't even manage to answer Fizz Buzz - one of the easiest interview questions around. It means
once you're good enough, your technical skills stops mattering anymore. At this point, networking becomes the key, because dev
teams are usually looking for someone that they know well and can work with for a long time.


## Networking

Just after your learning skills and mindset, this skill is the second most important skills to learn.

So what is networking exactly? It's very simple - making great friends, get along with them, help them throughout their life's
journey, and most importantly, being a great friend yourself. üòä

The first step in your professional networking is making new friends. And there's quite a lot of ways you can make friends -
in real-life tech conferences, recurring meetups, hackathons, code clubs, or even messaging people on social media like Twatter.

<AuthorNotes heading={"What if a networking event is too expensive for you?"} variant={"recommendation"}>
    It's not the end of the world yet! There are 2 things Leon recommends we all can do to skip paying the exorbitant
    event fees. I haven't tried them yet, but this seems to be battle-tested advice.

    * Write an email to the organizer(s) and ask them for a free ticket. You'll have a significant chance of being
    accepted this way, especially if you are a student.
    * Ask to volunteer in the event. Chances are the organizers want to save quite a lot of cost and want as many
    passionate people
    joining the event as possible at the same time, so they're likely looking for volunteers.
</AuthorNotes>

Here are the steps - it works both offline and online, even though there can be minor differences:

1. You should begin a conversation with a very short introduction about yourself - your name, your coding experience,
why you want to start a convo (most likely you're looking forwards to making a new friend), then request them to
start a conversation.
2. After that, guide the conversation to *focus on the other person* and get them to talk about themselves - you can discuss
the topic of the last keynote, or you can ask what they are passionate about, like Pok√©mons, and then talk about it. When talking, try to use their name often.
You now have an acquaintance.
3. A day after the conversation, send an email or DM to them and remind them about it! After that, you can provide value -
offer to help with something, get them to write about their day, or simply write about what they like again. For example,
if the other person is a fan of Pok√©mons, you can find the latest Pok√©mon news and write about it. Don't forget to thank
them for reading at the end of the message! üéÅ
4. A few days later, follow them on LinkedIn and Twitter if they have an account there, and
send another message if they have responded.
5. Repeat step 4 a few times with gradually increasing intervals between each message. Once you and your acquaintance
know each other well, you two have become friends!
6. Request a 15 to 30 minute coffee chat. üçµ
7. Keep messaging them every month or two, or more often if they feel more important to you. This keeps your friendship
fresh. If the other side messages you first, respond to them as soon as possible.

You should network with at least 3 people a week, and after a year, you'll get more than 150 friends!

## The Rolodex

If steps 4, 5 and 7 sound familiar to you, that's because they're <ColorEmphasis>spaced repetition</ColorEmphasis> in action!
These steps are meant to solidify your budding friendship in your brain.

But tracking a lot of people this way seems to be a *massive* hassle! Fortunately, there's a concept called the *rolodex*
that can help you with this. They allow you to fill in information about a person and reference it each time you have a
chat.

Usually the information that you can fill in include the person's name, their gender (don't assume it üåà), their birthday,


Either you can do it manually using Leon's template, or you can use a rolodex with spaced repetition baked in. The free
version of <a href="https://clay.earth"><ColorEmphasis>clay.earth</ColorEmphasis></a> is more than enough for the job.

## Quality over Quantity

Be careful who you make friends with! There's research pointing to 150 people being the maximum number of friends you can
have, and you cannot focus on everyone beyond this number. Most likely this results in your friendships losing a
lot of quality.

{/* TODO: Translate the Vietnamese proverb more accurately */}
There's a popular Vietnamese proverb "if you're near ink, you will be black, and if you're near light, you will be bright" -
it also applies to this industry too. The more high-achieving people and quality friends in your network, the more
likely you'll progress faster and be a better friend overall, and your career and your life also have a huge tailwind. üçÉ

Because of this, it's very natural of people to reserve as much of the 150-people space in your head as possible for the
high-achieving people and folks who make great friends around you. This creates a paradox though - successful people do
the same and tend to allocate their mental space for other successful people, leaving you with next to no opportunity
to reach out to them.

There are a few ways that can increase the chance of making friends with them though:

* If the high-achieving folk attends a conference, join with a friend or two. Try to approach them as a group - they're
more likely to engage in your conversations as they can help more people at once.
* If you have a lot of friends, you can ask some to refer you to them. Some of them might know the folk whom you're
trying to reach out to!

If both of these options do not work, and you don't have a lot of friends, maybe you should start small! Make friends
with those who are slightly ahead of you on their journey, and then try to work up from there.

Remember that <ColorEmphasis>a quality friendship goes both ways</ColorEmphasis> though - it's logically impossible for
everyone to only be friends with those that are slightly ahead of themselves, and being a sycophant is a very horrible
thing!

After all, it's not the attitude towards the people who are ahead of you, but the attitude towards the
people who are struggling behind you that makes all the difference. Instead of only trying to find mentors to help
yourself, try to make friends with folks who are catching up or lagging! Everyone will win if you can strike a balance.


## #100Devs is a Community.

The magic of #100Devs is that it's a free, community taught program! That is, not only Leon will be teaching you for free,
but there are other members that also contribute to it.

Some alumni even opt for streaming to teach more advanced concepts that go beyond the core program, like @helloitsrufio,
@mayanwolfe and @RascalTwo. Other members who cannot dedicate their time towards the program will regularly turn up in
the Discord help channels and will answer practically every question about web development and get you unstuck pretty
quickly.

However, like every mutual aid relationship, <ColorEmphasis>it goes both ways</ColorEmphasis>. As your professional skills
grow, the program needs your help to thrive. You can start by visiting the #code-help channel daily and checking on questions.
If you know an answer, don't hesitate to give one! You should also have an accountability partner that will help you sustain
your learning habit, and vice versa.

<AuthorNotes variant={"warning"} heading={"Going beyond?"}>
    Education is a human right, not a privilege! Therefore, it must be free of charge for everyone.

    This philosophy is actively championed by Leon and every contributing member at #100Devs.

    If you decide to go beyond, like sharing #100Devs illustrations and notes on the internet, streaming web development
    content specifically tailored to our community members, or making dedicated resources for the community, you are not
    allowed to charge anyone for your content under any means.
