This journey will open a lot of doors for you, but it will *not* be easy. You're going to face a ton of challenges and difficulties,
spend nights and weekends, sacrifice your valuable time with loved ones, and you'll have to be consistent towards your goal
even in the depths of your frustration.

In this lesson, I'll talk about the giant Trough of Sorrow that lies ahead of you, and summarize the three things you'll need to do in order to
overcome this one.


## Trough of Sorrow
So what is the so-called Trough of Sorrow?

<ServerImage slug={"/trough-of-sorrow.jpg"} alt={"The Trough of Sorrow"}></ServerImage>

The <ColorEmphasis color="#FF6666">*Trough of Sorrow*</ColorEmphasis> is a term that is very popular in the entrepreneurship world, as getting a startup to take off requires tremendous
effort and consistency.

But it also applies to *practically* any field that requires a lot of skills and expertise - and web development is no exception!

The initial phase is dubbed by Leon as *the Udemy hill*. That is because many new web developers go
through Udemy or Coursera to learn their first web development lessons. However, after probably 1 to 2 courses, the novelty soon wears off. They'll usually be trapped in a tutorial hell,
or simply don't know how to proceed from there!

{/* TODO: How many weeks? I remember that there needs to be at least 30. */}
{/* TODO: Should I mention that some folks move faster? I don't want new learners to compare with others. */}
The next phase is the <ColorEmphasis color="#FF6666">*Trough of Sorrow*</ColorEmphasis>. That is an excruciatingly period
where what you learn is getting increasingly more difficult, you don't feel you made any progress, and you don't feel confident
to apply for a job yet. The #100devs program will take at least 30 weeks to complete and get you out of this long phase.

{/* TODO: There are 2 more phases named "releases of improvement" and "crash of ineptitude". Should I include them? */}

{/* TODO: Tooltip needed here. The "applying" here doesn't mean applying, it is a long process, including meeting
and making friends with a company's various employees. Clicking apply never works. */}
After passing through the long trough, your skills will have improved a lot, and you will feel more confident applying
for a job! The job hunt starts from this phase. You'll start "applying" and networking your way into jobs, but more often
than not, you'll get ghosted or rejected, often without a clear reason, which will let you down. We call this
*Wiggles of False Hope*.

But don't worry too much, with consistent effort, you'll get past the interview rounds and receive an offer letter.
At this point, you'll be into <ColorEmphasis>the promised land</ColorEmphasis>! You'll only need to review the job offer
carefully, and after that, the job that promises a life of professional growth and a (usually) giant paycheck will be yours.

To go through the entire journey, there are 3 things that will come in handy!

## Managing Frustration

Yep. There will be a *ton* of frustration on your coding journey. Every once in a while, you'll be stuck on a problem,
like... styling float layouts, and you'll find yourself going around in circles, searching StackOverflow articles after
StackOverflow articles for an answer. When I'm in that kind of situation, I'll send myself into a horrible rage.
Sometimes self-harm, if severe enough.

Please don't be like me and try to manage your frustrations when these roadblocks inevitably come. If you ever get stuck
on a problem, maybe try going outside for a while or do another activity. You'll be better positioned to find a solution,
and things will click after you take that well-deserved break. üòÖ

P.S: I'll try to translate and post some breathing techniques I've learned from my therapist.

## Consistency

There can be *too much* of anything, including learning! After a specific point, you won't be able to absorb a lot
of information anymore, which means it's time to call it a day.

There is also a thing named *not learning often enough*. You'll gradually forget a skill as soon as you don't practice it,
so consistent learning and practicing is a must for practically any skill under the sun.

Try to block some time every day for your learning and networking, even it's only 30 minutes! It's better compared to only learning 3-4
hours on Sundays and forgetting everything on weekdays. You're here in a marathon, not a sprint, so cramming everything that way won't work.


## Self-care

Hey friend! Don't forget to take care of yourself. It's an incredibly important, but overlooked, part of the learning
process. A healthy body makes a healthy mind, after all.

Here are some self-care tips that can help you:

- Take breaks after each 25 minutes of deeply focused work. This technique is called "Pomodoro". üçÖ
- Drink water often! Try to enjoy a sip of water every break and don't get yourself thirsty. ü•§
- Take a healthy amount of sleep time every day. The necessary time varies by person, but it is usually 8 hours. üí§
- Get yourself to laugh more - like tuning in to watch a comedy.
- Practice breathing techniques. üò§
- Go outside and exercise more! It can be any type, for example, swimming.
- Listen to relaxing music. üéµ
