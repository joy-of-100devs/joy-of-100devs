Web development is not an easy thing to learn! There is quite a ton of concepts ahead of you, and it's incredibly hard,
if not impossible altogether, to plow through a hard concept without the correct techniques! In this lesson, we'll
summarize a few popular techniques that will help you through the learning process.

At the end of the lesson, I recommend you to check out <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn"><ColorEmphasis>*Learning How To Learn*</ColorEmphasis></a> on Coursera!
It was official study material for the second cohort, and almost certainly will be included in the later cohorts.
This article is simply trying to summarize its contents.

Sit tight, as it's one of the most important lessons on this platform! The techniques that you learn from this lesson can carry
over to any disciplines imaginable. üìï

## Practice makes Permanent

{/* TODO: Is this kind of analogy good? */}
Practice makes permanent! Take an example of a game where you draw a cute animal on a paper by connecting many different points, but you've
only got, say, a 4B pencil. If you're in the world of art, you'll know that a 4B pencil is very, very light. As a result, you'll need to trace
a lot of times to get a decent drawing.

Learning is a similar process. By practicing a lot of times, you'll create and strengthen pathways between your neurons.

When you first begin to understand something, it's similar to finishing the first pass of the drawing.
It's still a very faint trace of an animal, and you'll need to reinforce that! When you manage to apply a thing to solve
on your own, you can compare it to having a slightly darker trace that has gone through a few passes.

And when you can completely understand every nook and cranny of the thing you want to understand, and can teach it to other folx,
it's similar to getting a clear, bold drawing of the animal. üñºÔ∏è

<AuthorNotes heading={"Analogy please!"} variant={"recommendation"}>
    As you guessed, analogies are an effective technique you can use to grasp a concept! Because of it, I'll try to
    include
    sprinkles of analogies throughout the platform.

    However, sometimes I might not come up with an analogy good enough to use, and you might find the content a bit too
    dry. üòÖ

    If you want to contribute and ever come up with one during your lesson that can help other people understand it
    better,
    you can contact me using the report problem button to the bottom left, or make a PR on GitHub. I appreciate every
    piece
    of constructive criticism too!

## Focused and Diffuse Learning

Have you ever wondered why it seems to take hours to crack at a problem, only for you to then solve it after coming back from a break?
It's because your mind ran free, and a second, not-well-known mode of learning kicked in when you were taking that well-deserved tea break. ‚òï

This second mode you need is called <ColorEmphasis>*diffuse*</ColorEmphasis> learning. When you alternate between it and
<ColorEmphasis>*focused*</ColorEmphasis> learning, your learning will be much more effective! It's similar to lifting
weights - you wouldn't be able to be good at it only by practicing for a few days like a maniac - you'd need to consistently
alter between practice and rest.


## Spaced Repetition

Let's return to the drawing example! Imagine you want to speed this process up rapidly by hurriedly tracing the lines
connecting the dots. What would likely happen is you can break the pencil, or you can make mistakes tracing the line,
making the drawing much worse than what you would want it to be.

Trying to cram what you need to learn in a short period also gives you a jumbled, incoherent mess in your brain that won't last for long,
and a bunch of cheese holes in your knowledge.

On the opposite end, not reinforcing often enough will cause you to quickly forget what you learned! Your metabolic vampires
will suck away half of your newly learned knowledge in a matter of days to weeks, so you'll need to act fast.

You can achieve a balance with a technique called <ColorEmphasis>Spaced Repetition</ColorEmphasis>. Here's how it works:

1. Review as soon as possible after you've learned and understood a concept. Try to ensure you can successfully recall it twice in a row.
2. After 1 day, attempt to retrieve the concept again.
3. Repeat step 2, but slowly increase the waiting period to 3 days, 7 days, and so on.

Now, if you have to manage the entire process on your own and track dozens to hundreds of concepts a day, you'll quickly burn out! üòÖ
Fortunately, Anki is a great free software that can manage everything for you. You'll be using it a lot on your #100devs journey.

Naturally, writing down pairs of questions and answers combines extremely well with spaced repetition, since you can only see the questions
during a review, and you're forced to recall the answer. This technique reigns supreme over any traditional note-taking methods.

## Procrastination

Yep. Practically every one of us suffers from it from time to time - a nagging feeling of really not wanting to do things that you need.
I procrastinate too - sometimes, I find myself playing video games while trying to tackle challenges like this platform. But why does it happen?

Turns out that every time we look at things we really dislike doing, it seems that we activate areas of our brains associated
with **pain**. Our brains then attempt to focus on something else to get rid of the unease. The result is that you'll temporarily
feel happier, but when you inevitably need to return to the task, you realize nothing has been done! üò±

However, it is discovered that not long after we start working on the unpleasant tasks, the discomfort seems to just go away!

Try to eat your frogs first at the start of each day - you start off your day with mental clarity, and after finishing them,
you'll get enough momentum to deal with other tasks.

Additionally, Pomodoro is an excellent technique you can use to combat procrastination. I'll introduce this technique later in this article!


## The Pomodoro

One of the best solutions that is mentioned in the *Learning How To Learn* course is the Pomodoro technique. You'll get
a tomato if you translate it from Italian, because your timer will usually look like a tomato. üçÖ

It's really simple - 25 minutes of study, uninterrupted work, then 5 minutes of break time, and repeat! The sauce of the pomodoro is
to reward yourself with a small treat after each focus session! It can be web surfing, playing with a puppy or a kitten,
but one of the rewards that you should always take is a *sip of water*.

Another, more popular variation of Pomodoro is after every 4th focus session, you'll get 15 minutes of break time instead of only five.


## Chunking

When you first learn a brand-new concept, it looks like a strange, jumbled, complicated mess to you. That's because the
stuff you learned is only existing as isolated pieces. Through the process of chunking, these will unite into a coherent
and meaningful group. This group is much easier to remember and can fit into the larger picture, and you can apply them
creatively to solve various problems!

One ingredient of attaining any type of skills is creating chunks, and joining chunks together.

When you're learning to code a static news article in HTML like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/cricket/66359901">this one</a> (which is what we'll learn in the next module), after getting a rough
understanding of the pattern, we'll have to break down into tiny pieces of HTML like this:

```html
<img src="/an-example-image.png" alt="This is an example image.">
```

Each HTML element you learned will form a puzzle piece-like chunk in your mind. After that, you join these pieces to create bigger
pieces - groups of smaller, but related puzzle pieces. Here are some that I can come up with:

- Sections of the article - its subheadings, paragraphs and images grouped together.
- The article content - a collection of the main heading, the article's author, publish date, and a bunch of sections of content.
- The header of the webpage - the logo, the navigation links and the search bar.
- A group of links to related articles.

You'll then join these bigger pieces to make a complete page! Once you make the mini-chunks well-ingrained enough in your mind,
you can creatively mix them together to make completely new pages that doesn't have to be a news article. ‚≠ê


{/* TODO: Add tooltip to hint that this part is altered to  */}
So... how do you create a chunk? You only need 4 steps:

1. Focus intently on the thing you want to learn. If you're preoccupied with other things, you don't have enough mental
resources to link memory traces together. üçÖ
2. Understand the chunk's core idea. Otherwise, the new chunk won't be quite useful to you.
Work-through examples will help you understand the purpose of each step and the main idea!
3. To make the chunks actually *yours*, tie them together in a bigger context - and to avoid being preoccupied with a single step, you'll
need to try working out the solution again on your own, and then <ColorEmphasis>messing around with it</ColorEmphasis> if you can!
In the context of coding, you'll need to break your code gazillions of times to understand how it works.
4. *Teach* other folks who are not as familiar with your concept, and identify cheese holes in your knowledge. If some are found, fix it and repeat.


## Einstellung and Interleaving

What is *Einstellung*? It's a concept that what you previously learned can prevent you from trying out better, more
viable solutions or strategies. For example, I was toying with an old framework named jQuery and wasn't aware of the power of React,
so I was stuck writing bad, imperative code in jQuery for *ages*. (doesn't mean jQuery itself is bad, but React helps devs write much,
much more concise, modular, and manageable code). There are 3 main ways you can deal with Einstellung:

1. Sometimes, your old ideas that you learned can be too oversimplified, or outright misleading. In this case, you need to unlearn
them and replace with better ones.
2. Your ideas are alright, but there are even more optimal solutions that benefit you. This is where <ColorEmphasis>*deliberate practice*</ColorEmphasis>
comes in handy! Instead of repeating mindlessly what you've learned, deliberately focus on the difficult parts.
3. Alternate your focus back and forth between different problems, situations, or disciplines. This allows you to gather
diverse ideas from one fields and apply them in another field in interesting ways! This technique is called *interleaving*.


## Learning with Pictures

Your brain is built to memorize spatial and visual information much more effectively than abstract concepts! There's an
evolutionary reason for that - your ancestors needed it to navigate hostile environments, remember locations of good food,
and basically survive. This is a mechanism that drives the effectiveness of metaphors and analogies!


## Sleep

An average person needs at least 8 hours of sleep a day! Even with a day of lack of sleep, your brain will be poisoned with your own metabolic toxins,
and your ability to learn things will dwindle. This effect will unfortunately linger for quite some time even after you resume having enough sleep.

There are a few more benefits of sleeping - your brain automatically reinforces things that you've newly learned during the process, and your
unconscious brain will figure out a lot of your hard problems and use the diffused mode of learning even when you're sleeping!
