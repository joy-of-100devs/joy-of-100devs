Web development is not an easy thing to learn! There is quite a ton of concepts ahead of you, and it's incredibly hard,
if not impossible altogether, to plow through a hard concept without the correct techniques! In this lesson, we'll
summarize a few popular techniques that will help you through the learning process.

At the end of the lesson, I recommend you to check out <ColorEmphasis>*Learning How To Learn*</ColorEmphasis> on Coursera!
It was official study material for the second cohort, and almost certainly will be included in the later cohorts.
This article is simply trying to summarize its contents.

Sit tight, as it's one of the most important lessons on this platform! The techniques that you learn from this lesson can carry
over to any disciplines imaginable. üìï


## Focused and Diffuse Learning

Have you ever wondered why it seems to take hours to crack at a problem, only for you to then solve it after coming back from a break?
It's because your mind ran free, and a second, not-well-known mode of learning kicked in when you were taking that well-deserved tea break. ‚òï

This second mode you need is called <ColorEmphasis>*diffuse*</ColorEmphasis> learning. When you alternate between it and
<ColorEmphasis>*focused*</ColorEmphasis> learning, your learning will be much more effective! It's similar to lifting
weights - you wouldn't be able to be good at it only by practicing for a few days like a maniac - you'd need to consistently
alter between practice and rest.

<AuthorNotes heading={"Analogy please!"} variant={"success"}>
    As you guessed, analogies are an effective technique you can use to grasp a concept! Because of it, I'll try to
    include
    sprinkles of analogies throughout the platform.

    However, sometimes I might not come up with an analogy good enough to use, and you might find the content a bit too
    dry. üòÖ

    If you want to contribute and ever come up with one during your lesson that can help other people understand it
    better,
    you can contact me using the report problem button to the bottom left, or make a PR on GitHub. I appreciate every
    piece
    of constructive criticism too!

## Procrastination
Yep. Practically every one of us suffers from it from time to time - a nagging feeling of really not wanting to do things that you need.
I procrastinate too - sometimes, I find myself playing video games while trying to tackle challenges like this platform. But why does it happen?

Turns out that every time we look at things we really dislike doing, it seems that we activate areas of our brains associated
with **pain**. Our brains then attempt to focus on something else to get rid of the unease. The result is that you'll temporarily
feel happier, but when you inevitably need to return to the task, you realize nothing has been done! üò±

However, it is discovered that not long after we start working on the unpleasant tasks, the discomfort seems to just go away!


### The Pomodoro

One of the best solutions that is mentioned in the *Learning How To Learn* course is the Pomodoro technique. You'll get
a tomato if you translate it from Italian, because your timer will usually look like a tomato. üçÖ

It's really simple - 25 minutes of deep, uninterrupted work, then 5 minutes of break time, and repeat! The sauce of the pomodoro is
to reward yourself with a small treat after each focus session! It can be web surfing, playing with a puppy or a kitten,
but one of the rewards that you should always take is a *sip of water*.

Another, more popular variation of Pomodoro is after every 4th focus session, you'll get 15 minutes of break time instead of only five.


## Practice makes Permanent

{/* TODO: Is this kind of analogy good? */}
Practice makes permanent! Take an example of a game where you draw a cute animal on a paper by connecting many different points, but you've
only got, say, a 4B pencil. If you're in the world of art, you'll know that a 4B pencil is very, very light. As a result, you'll need to trace
a lot of times to get a decent drawing.

Learning is a similar process. By practicing a lot of times, you'll create and strengthen pathways between your neurons.

When you first begin to understand something, it's similar to finishing the first pass of the drawing.
It's still a very faint trace of an animal, and you'll need to reinforce that! When you manage to apply a thing to solve
on your own, you can compare it to having a slightly darker trace that has gone through a few passes.

And when you can completely understand every nook and cranny of the thing you want to understand, and can teach it to other folx,
it's similar to getting a clear, bold drawing of the animal. üñºÔ∏è
