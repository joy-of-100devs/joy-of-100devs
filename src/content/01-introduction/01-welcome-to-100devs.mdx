Welcome to our #100devs community!

As far as I know, this is one of the largest and best web development communities where you can become a software engineer for _free_.
When I first learn web development, I was _horribly_ stuck in tutorial hell, and found myself going tutorial after tutorial on Coursera without significant development in my skills. ðŸ˜¬
The community reignited my passion for web development and helped me grow at an incredibly fast place.

And so, as a gift of gratitude, I made this supplemental course platform for you! This is designed as support
material for Leon's #100devs videos, but you can find sprinkles of extra stuff that I learned during my own journey!

## #100devs and this platform are both free!

The awesome #100devs program is free! You don't have to pay a single dime to enjoy the best of #100devs, and you cannot pay Leon for it.
(if you try to donate to his channel on Twitch, he'll just give your donation to <a href="https://resilientcoders.org"><ColorEmphasis>*Resilient Coders*</ColorEmphasis></a>,
an organization that also helps fellow people of color get jobs in tech.)

Following the spirit of #100devs and Leon's dream of making education free for everyone, this supplemental platform is also completely free of charge!

<AuthorNotes heading={"Here be dragons."} variant={"warning"}>
    This course platform is an unofficial work in progress by an alum from #100devs.
    It is not in any way affiliated or endorsed by #100devs for the foreseeable future, and only serves as a complement -
    not a replacement for live courses, and I recommend you to join the streams because they're a lot of fun!

    The platform is in alpha, which means that the content will be extremely incomplete and may not align well with the
    official program.
    I'll also need a lot of feedback and support to make it better! If you find any problem or want to contribute to this project,
    please use the report problem button on the bottom left of the screen, ping me as minidev#3301 on Discord in the
    #100devs community, or make an issue/pull request on GitHub repositories!

    Please also note that the course platform can be cancelled if it is unable to help the #100devs community.
