There are a bunch of features that makes this course stand out among other courses!

## Code Playgrounds

You'll see beautiful [WIP] code playgrounds like these scattered throughout the platform, like this one:
<CodePlayground repository={"/01/06/preview-playground"}></CodePlayground>

The code playground has some features:
- Click on the magic wand on the top right to make your code look neater.
- Click on the circular arrow to reset everything back to original.
- Click on the arrow box to open the code playground in CodeSandbox - basically a much more robust version of
this code playground that can pay for features like server-side code and asset hosting.
- Edit any of the files, and you will see them reflected in the preview window.
- Go to the console tab to get logs - you'll learn about the console when we get to the Javascript module.
- Your code will be auto-saved. If there is a bugs in your saved code snippets, you can always reset by clicking the
circular arrow on the top right.

Shoutout to <ColorEmphasis>Josh Comeau</ColorEmphasis> for his awesome tutorials on how to make a code playground like this one! You can always visit his

<AuthorNotes heading={"Playground Limitations"} variant={"warning"}>
  The code playgrounds are powered by Sandpack, which is meant to be a lightweight technology to run code snippets on
  the web.
  Because of that, there are some **big** technical caveats with the playground:

  - You can't put images, videos or any non-text files inside the playground, even if it is an SVG.
  - You can't create new files or delete files (yet). I will be working on a context menu and modal
  that help with this process soon.
  - Even though you can run some server-side code on Sandpack, you'll not be able to use very important
  code libraries. For example, you cannot connect to many database systems.

  I had been thinking about an alternative solution - not use Sandpack and implement a backend system similar to
  CodeSandbox, using MicroVMs under the hood. However, the cost of maintaining and operating such a system would
  put a price tag in hundreds of dollars on this course platform. ðŸ¥µ

  Don't worry! You'll learn to use another IDE called Visual Studio Code in the course.

Now we've finished talking about #100devs, we're ready going into the fun trough of sorrow of web development! ðŸš€
