Welcome to your first actual lesson on this course platform, where you'll learn to build scalable and beautiful web
applications with the help of HTML, CSS, JS and the MERN stack. üòÑ

I'm so excited to show you all how everything works in the next 30 weeks! Let's start with something small first - you
need to get the hang of how websites work first before you can build your first website.


## The Internet and Websites

No website can ever exist without the Internet - this giant network of computers is what allows building blocks that makes
websites to travel to your computer. üåê

This giant network is very complicated, and there are so many underlying mechanisms that makes the Internet functional.
For example - HTTP protocol on the application layer, TCP/UDP protocol on the transport layer, IP protocol on the network layer,
protocols on the link layer like CSMA, the wire/wireless transmission medium, 3 layers of domain name servers, IPv6 to IPv4 tunnelling,
public IP and routing table, yada, yada.

To be honest, I can't even understand *half* of these concepts when studying Computer Networks. ü•µ

So let's abstract it, and let system and network engineers like the folks at Railway, Heroku, or AWS manage the rest for
you! For all practical intents and purposes of web development, we can treat the Internet as a single
<ColorEmphasis>**wire**</ColorEmphasis> connecting your computer and another computer.

## How websites appear on your computer

When you are viewing this website, your computer acts as a *client*, while that other computer is a *server* that sends
this webpage to you in the form of files. This is known in the tech world as the *client-server model*.

{/* TODO: CSS art of the process in action, using framer-motion! */}
Here's how the process of getting the website to your PC works:

1. First, the client sends a first request to the server.
2. The server sends an HTML file back to you. The file has to be HTML, otherwise, what appears is no longer a website. It
defines the structure and content of the current page you're looking at.
3. After receiving the HTML, the client processes the HTML file and content starts appearing. The HTML document might point
to more resources like stylesheets (stuff that makes the webpage have an appearance) and scripts (stuff that allows
you to interact with the page). They need to be fetched from the server.
4. The server sends more requests to the server to get these resources.
5. After getting all the extra stuff, our website is complete.

And with the basic understanding of the Internet, let's start building our first Hello World in HTML in the next lesson!
