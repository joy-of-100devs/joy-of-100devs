Who likes strawberry ice cream? In this lesson, let's build a recipe page for this tasty treat using all HTML building
blocks you've learned so far. üç¶

{/* TODO: Actually make a custom webpage about the ice cream recipe - there might be copyright issues. */}

## Before you begin

There are a few things that you need to know about this exercise:

- This exercise is only intended to help you practice assembling HTML like putting together LEGO bricks! We haven't
learned the standard structure of an HTML document yet - which we will learn soon in a few more modules. üß±
- Your HTML page isn't supposed to be beautiful or neatly laid out yet, and you should never use HTML elements based on
how big or small the element is! This job should be dedicated to CSS, which we'll learn later. This philosophy is called the
<ColorEmphasis>*separation of concerns*</ColorEmphasis>. In this exercise, I added a stylesheet called
<code>reset.css</code> to make every element look the same - this should hammer the point home. üìÉ
- After looking at the solution, I recommend you to play with the code and break stuff.


Without further ado, let's start working on making your first web page!

In case you don't know how to make ice cream like me, you can use one of these <ColorEmphasis color={"#ff7777"}>reference recipes</ColorEmphasis>
to help you. Click on each item to open the respective recipe!

- <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/140877/easy-eggless-strawberry-ice-cream/">Recipe from allrecipes.com</a>
- <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/strawberry-ice-cream/">Recipe from bbcgoodfood.com</a>
- <a href="https://www.alattefood.com/homemade-strawberry-ice-cream/">Recipe from alattefood.com</a>


## Acceptance Criteria

- The recipe page is for a hypothetical website called <code>https://recipes.example.com</code>
- There should be a header containing a clickable logo, some navigation links to different categories of dishes.
- There should be one primary heading that names the recipe and an image of the finished dessert with caption.
- You should include some information about the author of the recipe.
- There should be one main element and an article wrapping around the recipe.
- There should be one section that describes the necessary ingredients for the recipe and one section that contains the
recipe's instructions. Use lists whenever appropriate!
- You should use paragraphs for text content.
- For now, you can use absolute URLs like <code>{"https://recipes.example.com/categories/dessert"}</code>.
We'll learn more about URLs in depth soon!

[//]  # (TODO: This part needs images, but I don't have a lot of images, and I can't read the legalese. In the worst
case, I'll have to draw them ALL out)
[//]  # (- There should be images with alt tags that accompany every step of the instruction, and every image should be)
[//]  # (captioned with the original author of the image.)
- There should be an aside tag containing related recipes.
- You don't need to include user ratings or reviews for this exercise.
- At the end of the page, there should be a footer with some navigation links to the recipe categories (same as in the
page header) and some links to the recipe website's legal documents like <code>{"https://recipes.example.com/terms"}</code>
or <code>{"https://recipes.example.com/privacy"}</code>.

## Solution

How did you feel about this first exercise? It's meant to be hard.

It's OK even if your markup doesn't align well with the solution, you've still learned and grown a lot! After all, every
one of us has been a code baddie and has written bad code, at least at some point. üå±

If you look at the images in the playground, many of them don't actually work. This is because in many cases, it's very
hard to find a proper non-copyrighted image, and I replaced with links from an example website that doesn't exist. I'll
try to gather proper images soon!

First, let's make the header of the file. The structure should be like this. Note that the <code>nav</code> >
<code>ul</code> > <code>li</code> > <code>a</code> is quite a common pattern:

```html
<header>
  <a href="https://recipes.example.com">
    <img alt="Website Logo" src="https://recipes.example.com/static/logo.png"/>
  </a>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://recipes.example.com/breakfasts">Breakfasts</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://recipes.example.com/lunches">Lunches</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://recipes.example.com/dinners">Dinners</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://recipes.example.com/occasions">Occasions</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://recipes.example.com/appetizers">Appetizers</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://recipes.example.com/main-courses">Main courses</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://recipes.example.com/desserts">Desserts</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

Now let's proceed to the primary content of the page! The outer wrapper should be a <code>main</code> container, and the
content should be split into 2 parts - an <code>article</code> containing the ice cream recipe
and a <code>aside</code> element containing related recipes.

```html
<main>
  <article></article>
  <aside></aside>
</main>
```

Inside the <code>article</code> element, let's insert a heading, the author information, article publish date,
and an image of the finished ice cream from Unsplash and put these items into a header element.

```html
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Strawberry Ice Cream</h1>
    <address>By Johnny Appleseed</address>
    <p>Updated on <time>May 6, 2023</time></p>
    <p>Here's a super easy way to make a tasty ice cream.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1633933358116-a27b902fad35?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1364&q=80" alt="Finished strawberry ice cream">
      <figcaption>Here's what a finished strawberry ice cream will look like!</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </header>
</article>
```

Right after that, insert another section about the recipe's ingredients below it! The heading should be h2 - because
it is a child of the heading containing the recipe name.

Optionally, you can add <code>strong</code> elements to highlight the keyword!

```html
<article>
  <!-- ...previous content here -->
  <section>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Strawberries</li>
      <li>Whole milk</li>
      <li>Double cream or heavy cream</li>
      <li>White sugar</li>
      <li>A little vanilla extract and salt</li>
      <li>Lemon juice (optional)</li>
      <li>Egg yolk (optional)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</article>
```

<AuthorNotes heading={"HTML comments"} variant={"recommendation"}>
  An HTML comment can be used to explain the content below it, create a reminder of what to do to improve the content,
  or signal something else entirely to other developers! Only developers will be able to see it - the comment will be
  hidden from your users.

  An HTML comment starts with the sequence <code>{"<!--"}</code> - a less-than sign, an exclamation mark, and 2 hyphens,
  and ends with <code>{"-->"}</code>- 2 hyphens followed by a greater than sign!

  This is an example of a comment:
  ```html
  <!-- ...previous content here -->
  ```
</AuthorNotes>

Next step, let's add a section of instructions for making the ice cream! For this section, you should organize steps
into an ordered list. You should also add multiple paragraphs to organize an item better.

```html
<article>
  <!-- ...previous content here -->
  <section>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use a blender to turn strawberries into strawberry pur√©e.</p>
        <p>If you want to make the ice cream a bit more tart, you can add a few teaspoons of lemon juice.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you want ice cream without egg yolks, simply mix everything together and put the mixture into an ice cream
          maker. Otherwise, you can continue with the next steps.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Warm the cream and milk in a pan until steaming.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Whisk the sugar and egg yolks for several minutes until the mixture turns yellow.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Slowly pour the hot cream and milk mixture into the pale yellow egg mixture while continuously whisking the
            contents inside the egg bowl.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pour the content back into the pan. Use a sieve to filter big particles in the process.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Cook the content over low-medium heat until it slightly thickens.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pour the cooked mixture onto the bowl, leave it cool for 10 minutes and inside the refrigerator for an hour.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Stir everything together then freeze everything in an ice cream maker.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
</article>
```

We'll proceed with adding related recipes to the already-existing <code>aside</code> element!
This is where you can add related recipes. For the heading, since we've already had an <code>h1</code> in the page, we'll
use an <code>h2</code> this time.

```html
<aside>
  <h2>Related Recipes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://recipes.example.com/recipes/strawberry-cake">Strawberry Cake</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://recipes.example.com/recipes/chocolate-ice-cream">Chocolate Ice Cream</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://recipes.example.com/recipes/strawberry-pudding">Strawberry Pudding</a>

    <li>
      <a href="https://recipes.example.com/recipes/banana-macaroons">Banana Macaroons</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</aside>
```

Let's end with a page footer! You should wrap a <code>small</code> element around the copyright, and everything else
should be similar to the header at the top!

```html
<footer>
  <a href="https://recipes.example.com">
    <img alt="Website Logo" src="https://recipes.example.com/static/logo.png"/>
  </a>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://recipes.example.com/breakfasts">Breakfasts</a></li>

    </ul>
  </nav>
  <nav>

      <li><a href="https://recipes.example.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</footer>
```

And that's it for the exercise! Here's the full code on the playground so that you can play around with it:
