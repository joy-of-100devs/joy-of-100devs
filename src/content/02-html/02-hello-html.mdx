In this lesson, we'll learn about what HTML is, and then build a Hello World website in HTML together!


## What is HTML?

HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It's a markup language that makes the content and structure of
almost every website. On your computer, you can use the extension *.html* to tell HTML files from other files.

Every HTML document can be broken into small blocks called *elements* that tell the browser what to
display on the user's screen.
