In this lesson, we'll learn about what HTML is, and then build a page about how to make a homemade pizza in HTML together!

HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It's a markup language that makes the content and structure of
almost every website. On your computer, you can use the extension *.html* to tell HTML files from other files.

## Anatomy of an HTML element

Every HTML document can be broken into small puzzle pieces called *elements* that tell the browser what to
display on the user's screen. üß©

Let's take a look at a few puzzle pieces to understand how HTML elements work!

Most HTML element can usually be dissected into 3 smaller pieces - an opening tag, the content, and its closing tag.
Hover on each element to reveal what each piece does!

Besides text, HTML elements can have one or more elements inside of them! Here's an example of a list with its items.

<HTMLElementDemo2></HTMLElementDemo2>

An HTML element can also have attributes - they tell the browser some extra information about the element.

In some cases, these attributes are necessary, or the element won't make sense at all! A decent analogy of this
is a signpost on the crossroads, and the attributes are where the signpost points too - a signpost without directions is
utterly useless.

For example, the anchor element <code>a</code> takes the user to another location on the Internet - it can be your own site, or
another site! The browser *needs* the <code>href</code> attribute to know where it should go.

<AuthorNotes heading={"Good to know!"} variant={"recommendation"}>
  HTML element names and attributes are case-insensitive. Therefore:
  - <code>h1</code>, and <code>H1</code> mean the same element, and
  - <code>LI</code>, <code>li</code>, <code>Li</code> and <code>lI</code> also mean the same element.
  - <code>href="https://discord.gg/100devs"</code> and <code>HrEf="https://discord.gg/100devs"</code> mean the same
  attribute.

  However, it's recommended to leave everything in lowercase for better readability!

## Important HTML elements

Before we make our first recipe page in HTML, we'll have to learn the core elements in HTML first! You'll be actively
using these elements most of the time when making this page and many, many other pages into the future.

### Headings

A heading serves a simple purpose - it quickly tells the user what the content they're about to read is, and using
headings breaks content into small chunks that they can understand. üìñ

They also help a search engine determine what it's looking at, and a good usage of them is an easy way to help your page
be more visible on Google. üîç

There are 6 headings in HTML. <code>h1</code> is the most important heading, describes the content of the whole page,
and should be used exactly **once**.

<code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, <code>h4</code>, <code>h5</code>, and <code>h6</code> always follow
<code>h1</code> and describe gradually smaller and more specific chunks of content.

Remember to use the headings in the correct order!

```
// ‚úÖ Good practice
h1 > h2 > h3 > h4 > h5 > h6
h1 > h2 > h3
h1 > h2 > h3 > h4

// ‚ùå Bad practice
h1 > h3 > h4  // Skipped h2
h1 > h2 > h4 > h5  // Skipped h3
```

<AuthorNotes variant={"warning"} heading={"Don't pay attention to their sizes!"}>
  Trying to make the headings bigger or smaller to suit your needs is really bad practice! The only task that HTML does
  is to define the structure and content of the webpage, not its appearance. We'll learn another markup language that is
  better suited for this task called CSS in the next module.

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are groups of text that goes into detail about the topic that is mentioned in the heading, and they can appear
after one another. To make a paragraph, you can use the <code>{"<p>"}</code> tag. Here's an example playground:

<CodePlayground repository={"/02/02/hello-html-paragraphs-example"}></CodePlayground>


### Containing Elements

Every HTML page can be separated into coherent groups of related HTML elements. Once upon a time, there was no way to
label these elements except using <code>div</code>s, but the HTML5 specification introduces several elements that help!


#### Header

<code>header</code>s are elements that usually lies at the beginning of a webpage, or at the beginning of a section or
segment of a page.

If the header is right at the beginning of the page, they usually contain the website's logo or trademark, a
navigation container with links and buttons.

If the header is at the beginning of the section, they can contain its section's heading and other introductory content.


#### Footer

<code>footer</code>s are the opposite of footer.

If the footer is right at the end of the page, not only they are used to include links to other parts of
the website like a header, but they can also include the information of the website's author, some fine print, or some
links to legalese documents.

Otherwise, the footer can be used to conclude a section or any segment of the page.

#### Navigation

A navigation element contains a bunch of links that take users to different sections of your page. In a news
website, a navigation section can contain a link to the homepage, several links to popular topics, and sometimes, a link
to your account settings if the website allows you to log in and bookmark articles. You can create a navigation section
with a <code>{"<nav>"}</code> tag.

#### Article

An article denotes a piece of share-able content! Use an <code>{"<article>"}</code> tag and wrap around the piece of
content to make an article element.

What are the places that you can wrap an article tag around? In a news website, these places are... articles. In a
social media app, they are user posts. In a recipe app, they are a recipe. In a video-sharing app, they can be videos.

#### Section

A <code>{"<section>"}</code> is the most generic, but still semantic way, to group related pieces of content together.

If there's no exact tag that you can think of, yet you still need to meaningfully group a part of your page, go for
sections!

#### Aside

An aside bar holds stuff that is related to the current piece of content that the user's looking at.

It can be an explanation for a difficult term in an article, or some other pieces of content that are related to
the current content.

On this platform, I sometimes add Leon's recommendations and my recommendations in green or blue boxes. That's a great
candidate for an aside element!
