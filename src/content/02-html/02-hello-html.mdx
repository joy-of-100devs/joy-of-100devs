In this lesson, we'll learn about what HTML is, and then build a page about how to make a homemade pizza in HTML together!

HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It's a markup language that makes the content and structure of
almost every website. On your computer, you can use the extension *.html* to tell HTML files from other files.

## Anatomy of an HTML element

Every HTML document can be broken into small puzzle pieces called *elements* that tell the browser what to
display on the user's screen. üß©

Let's take a look at a few puzzle pieces to understand how HTML elements work!

Most HTML element can usually be dissected into 3 smaller pieces - an opening tag, the content, and its closing tag.
Hover on each element to reveal what each piece does! Note that throughout this course, I'll use the term *tag* and
*element* interchangeably.

Besides text, HTML elements can have one or more elements inside of them! Here's an example of a list with its items.

<HTMLElementDemo2></HTMLElementDemo2>

An HTML element can also have attributes - they tell the browser some extra information about the element.

In some cases, these attributes are necessary, or the element won't make sense at all! A decent analogy of this
is a signpost on the crossroads, and the attributes are where the signpost points too - a signpost without directions is
utterly useless.

For example, the anchor element <code>a</code> takes the user to another location on the Internet - it can be your own site, or
another site! The browser *needs* the <code>href</code> attribute to know where it should go.

<HTMLElementDemo3></HTMLElementDemo3>

<AuthorNotes heading={"Good to know!"} variant={"recommendation"}>
  HTML element names and attributes are case-insensitive. Therefore:
  - <code>h1</code>, and <code>H1</code> mean the same element, and
  - <code>LI</code>, <code>li</code>, <code>Li</code> and <code>lI</code> also mean the same element.
  - <code>href="https://discord.gg/100devs"</code> and <code>HrEf="https://discord.gg/100devs"</code> mean the same
  attribute.

  However, it's recommended to leave everything in lowercase for better readability!

## Important HTML elements

Before we make our first recipe page in HTML, we'll have to learn the core elements in HTML first! You'll be actively
using these elements most of the time when making this page and many, many other pages into the future.

### Headings

A heading serves a simple purpose - it quickly tells the user what the content they're about to read is, and using
headings breaks content into small chunks that they can understand. üìñ

They also help a search engine determine what it's looking at, and a good usage of them is an easy way to help your page
be more visible on Google. üîç

There are 6 headings in HTML. <code>h1</code> is the most important heading, describes the content of the whole page,
and should be used exactly **once**.

<code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, <code>h4</code>, <code>h5</code>, and <code>h6</code> always follow
<code>h1</code> and describe gradually smaller and more specific chunks of content.


<CodePlayground repository={"/02/02/hello-html-headings-example"}></CodePlayground>


Remember to use the headings in the correct order!

```
// ‚úÖ Good practice
h1 > h2 > h3 > h4 > h5 > h6
h1 > h2 > h3
h1 > h2 > h3 > h4

// ‚ùå Bad practice
h1 > h3 > h4  // Skipped h2
h1 > h2 > h4 > h5  // Skipped h3
```

### Paragraphs and Text Elements

Paragraphs are groups of text that goes into detail about the topic that is mentioned in the heading, and they can appear
after one another. To make a paragraph, you can use the <code>{"<p>"}</code> tag. Here's an example playground:

<CodePlayground repository={"/02/02/hello-html-paragraphs-example"}></CodePlayground>

For shorter pieces of text, you can use a <code>{"<span>"}</code> element as a generic option, but in some situations, other
elements work better!

- A <code>{"<time>"}</code> tag is best used for a specific time or date. A human-readable time should be added as the
<code>time</code> element's content, while a machine-readable format should be added as the value of the
<code>datetime</code> attribute, so that search engines can make sense of it, for example, to know when your page is
created! You'll learn how you can generate a standard time format when we get to the JavaScript module.

- A <code>{"<small>"}</code> tag is best used for the fine print of the document, like the license or brief description of
your website's copyright.

- An <code>{"<article>"}</code> tag represents information about the author that create the piece of content.

- Use <code>{"<code>"}</code> tag around pieces and snippets of code.

- A <code>{"<sub>"}</code> tag defines subscript text, which appear in chemical formulas like H<sub>2</sub>O.

- A <code>{"<sup>"}</code> tag defines superscript text, which appear in algebraic expressions like x<sup>2</sup>.

- A <code>{"<del>"}</code> tag can be used if a part of content that is out-of-date, but you still want to keep it in
your page.

- Use an <code>{"<ins>"}</code> tag if you go back to your page and want to add some new content to it.

- The <code>{"<strong>"}</code> element marks a piece of text as important.

- Use an <code>{"<em>"}</code> tag if you want to emphasize a piece of text.

### Containing Elements

Every HTML page can be separated into coherent groups of related HTML elements. Once upon a time, there was no way to
label these elements except using <code>div</code>s, but the HTML5 specification introduces several elements that help!

#### Header

<code>header</code>s are elements that usually lies at the beginning of a webpage, or at the beginning of a section or
segment of a page.

If the header is right at the beginning of the page, they usually contain the website's logo or trademark, a
navigation container with links and buttons.

If the header is at the beginning of the section, they can contain its section's heading and other introductory content.


#### Footer

<code>footer</code>s are the opposite of footer.

If the footer is right at the end of the page, not only they are used to include links to other parts of
the website like a header, but they can also include the information of the website's author, some fine print, or some
links to legalese documents.

Otherwise, the footer can be used to conclude a section or any segment of the page.

#### Navigation

A navigation element contains a bunch of links that take users to different sections of your page. In a news
website, a navigation section can contain a link to the homepage, several links to popular topics, and sometimes, a link
to your account settings if the website allows you to log in and bookmark articles. You can create a navigation section
with a <code>{"<nav>"}</code> tag.

There's one hidden feature of the navigation container - the search engine will not check anything that is inside the
nav tag to avoid counting the repeated navigation links multiple times.

#### Article

An article denotes a piece of share-able content! Use an <code>{"<article>"}</code> tag and wrap around the piece of
content to make an article element.

What are the places that you can wrap an article tag around? In a news website, these places are... articles. In a
social media app, they are user posts. In a recipe app, they are a recipe. In a video-sharing app, they can be videos.

#### Aside

An aside bar holds stuff that is related to the current piece of content that the user's looking at.

It can be an explanation for a difficult term in an article, or some other pieces of content that are related to
the current content - it does not need to be to the left or right of the main content.

On this platform, I sometimes add Leon's recommendations and my recommendations in green or blue boxes. That's a great
candidate for an aside element!

#### Section

A <code>{"<section>"}</code> is the most generic, but still semantic way, to group related pieces of content together.

If there's no exact tag that you can think of, yet you still need to meaningfully group a part of your page, go for
sections!

#### Main

A <code>{"<main>"}</code> element should wrap around the dominant content of the webpage, and there should only be one
per page. For example, an ordinary page of a news website should wrap around the article.

#### Divisors

If you want to group elements together only for the sake of layout or styling, and you've already added a semantic
container, then using divisors is a good idea! A divisor can be defined by a pair of <code>{"<div>"}</code> tags.

You will not need to use any divisors in this module though as you don't need to style stuff yet.


### Images

A picture is worth a thousand words! You can add images to help with conveying information to folks who read your page.

The syntax of an image is unique - unlike most elements, you'll not need a closing tag at all. Putting content inside
an image tag doesn't make sense either. There are a few more elements that share this behavior called *void elements*.

An image needs 2 attributes:
- An <code>src</code> attribute telling the browser where the image is on the Internet. It can be on another webpage,
or a place on your own server.
- An <code>alt</code> attribute tells the user what the image is if the user can't see the image for any reason, like
the user's visual disabilities, or the image is not found or fails to load.

```html
<img src="https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/mix/IMG_2840.jpg" alt="A picture of a dog">
```

To improve your image's semantics, you can combine a <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code>! Unlike the alt
attribute, sighted users can see what's in the <code>figcaption</code>. A <code>figcaption</code> can also tell users
about the original author of the photo.

```html
<figure>
    <img src="https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/mix/IMG_2840.jpg" alt="A picture of a dog">
    <figcaption>A picture of a cute white puppy</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Feel free to play with the image elements in this playground! Don't worry if the images look too large, we'll learn how
to make them fit the page later with CSS. üòÖ

<CodePlayground repository={"/02/02/hello-html-images-example"}></CodePlayground>

<AuthorNotes variant={"warning"} heading={"External images"}>
  Don't forget to check if you're allowed to use an image from the Internet! They might be copyrighted.

  In addition, avoid using images from external websites that you don't own, their contents can be changed or removed,
  leaving you and your users with a very bad site.

  For the next exercise only, you will practice with external, open-source images. Right after that, you'll learn how to
  link images from your own development server.

### Anchors

An anchor element takes the user to another page on the Interwebz!

You can specify a location with the <code>href</code> attribute like this.

```html
<a href="https://dog.ceo">dog.ceo website</a>
```

An anchor tag can also link to another page on your own website, but we'll learn how later in this module.

You can also opt to open the webpage in a new tab using the <code>target</code> attribtute.

```html
<a href="https://dog.ceo" target="_blank">this link opens in a new tab</a>
```

Here's a playground that you can tinker with!

<CodePlayground repository={"02/02/hello-html-anchors-example"}/>

### Lists

Last category of elements today, I promise! üòÖ

There are 2 kinds of lists:
- unordered lists (defined by an <code>ul</code> element)
- ordered lists (defined by an <code>ol</code> element).

The restaurant-themed equivalents would be a menu of ingredients and a set of instructions for a dish. Let's look at an
example pizza recipe! üßë‚Äçüç≥

Note that list items, defined by a pair of <code>{"<li>"}</code> tags, are the only elements allowed inside
the list elements.

<CodePlayground repository={"02/02/hello-html-lists-example"}/>

<AuthorNotes variant={"recommendation"} heading={"Good to know"}>
  An ordered lists has a few optional attributes that can help you!

  * The <code>reversed</code> attribute helps you reverse a list. You can use this to rank top 10 favourite movies from
  worst or best, for example. You don't need to include any value for this to work!
  * The <code>start</code> attribute helps you start the list from a higher number.
  * You can customize the list marker with the <code>type</code> attribute - you can swap the default marker with
  <code>i</code> or <code>I</code> (Roman numerals), <code>a</code> or <code>A</code> (alphabets), and <code>1</code>,
