We have used URLs as part of your first page before. In this lesson, let's learn about this concept in depth!

URLs are one of the most important pieces of the interwebz - they link web pages and various stuff from different places together.
Using URLs will not only give you the ability to access images, video and resources, it will also help you add styling and
interactivity to your page in a reusable way!

There are 2 kinds of URLs - relative URLs and absolute URLs. Let's walk through each of them! üìó

## Relative URL

What is a relative URL?

A relative URL is very similar to the file path that you see on your computer! It points to a
resource on your *own* website - be it another page, a script, an image, or something else.

There are 2 kinds of relative URLs - a root-relative URL and a non-root-relative URL.


### Root-relative URL

Imagine a server as a robot.

A root-relative URL always starts with a forward slash! This tells the robot to start from the top-most
folder that *the server knows*, called the <ColorEmphasis>*root folder*</ColorEmphasis>.

On your ordinary Windows computer, there can be many root folders like <code>C:\\</code> or <code>D:\\</code>, while on Mac and Linux or UNIX-like
operating systems, the root folder is called <code>/</code> and might contain folders like <code>bin</code>,
<code>etc</code>, <code>home</code>, <code>mnt</code>, <code>usr</code> and <code>var</code>.

In a typical web server, the root folder is also the project folder, which contains all the files that makes up your
website.

Let's understand how a root-relative URL works first!

<PathSimulator/>

In this demo, the *root folder* is the folder whose name is <code>/</code>, and contains files like
<code>terms.html</code> and some folders like <code>assets</code> and <code>recipes</code>.

If you type in <code>/</code> in the input box at the bottom of the demo, you'll see the root folder turn cyan.
Similarly, if the robot reaches a file or directory with the path you enter, that file or directory
glow <ColorEmphasis color="cyan">*light cyan*</ColorEmphasis>.

If you want the bot to reach a file or a folder inside the root folder, you only need to include the folder name after the
forward slash - the beginning slash is a special syntax! Here are 2 examples that you can feed into the demo:
```
/terms.html
/recipes
```

If you want to get to the <code>ice-cream</code> folder, you can go to the <code>recipes</code> folder, then
the <code>ice-cream</code> folder inside. Between each folder, there should be a forward slash, acting as a
separator! You can try this URL:
```
/recipes/ice-cream
```

Note that in this demo, folders that you've traversed through but don't match will turn <ColorEmphasis color="lime">*light
green*</ColorEmphasis> - these hints help you track your position in the file tree!


If you want to get to the <code>apple.jpg</code> file, you can go to the <code>assets</code> folder, then
the <code>recipes</code> folder inside, and finally reach the <code>apple.jpg</code> file.
Here's the URL that you can feed into the demo:
```
/assets/recipes/apple.jpg
```

Now we've learned the basics of a root-relative URL, you should try to get the robot turn every
file <ColorEmphasis color="cyan">*cyan*</ColorEmphasis> at least once using the
input box in the demo component!


### Non-root-relative URL

Now, let's talk about a non-root-relative URL. Unlike a root-relative URL, which always has a slash, a non-root-relative
URL can start from any folder - we call this the <ColorEmphasis>working directory</ColorEmphasis>.

<PathSimulator cwd={"/assets"}/>

In this example, the bot start from the <code>assets</code> folder, which is
marked <ColorEmphasis color={"#ff68c9"}>pink</ColorEmphasis>.

If you type in <code>recipes</code>, the recipe path will be cyan. That's because from the <code>assets</code>
recipe, the robot goes to the <code>recipes</code> folder inside of it.
```
recipes
```

Typing <code>recipes/strawberry.jpg</code> in the input box will turn the strawberry file cyan. Again, you need to use
the forward slash to separate the folder names/filenames.
```
recipes/strawbery.jpg
```

From anywhere on the file tree, if you add a dot <code>.</code>, it tells the robot to stay put where it is.

For example, if you type just a dot into the input box, we end up right where we started - the pink folder then
turns <ColorEmphasis color="cyan">cyan</ColorEmphasis>.

```
.
```

Here's another example - the robot starts from the <code>assets</code> folder, stays put there for 1 turn, then goes inside
the <code>web</code> folder, stays put there for the next 2 turns, and finally reaches the <code>icon.svg</code> file,
which turns cyan.

```
./web/././icon.svg
```

From anywhere in the file tree, if you add 2 dots <code>..</code>, it tells the machine to go up the tree, into the
parent folder. If the robot is already on the root folder, it discovers it can't go further, so it stays put on the
root folder.

For example, from the <code>assets</code> folder, all of these will allow our robot to reach the root folder on the
very top of the tree.

```
..
./..
../.
../..
.././..
```

Similar to the previous section, now let's try to help the robot reach every file in the tree!

<AuthorNotes heading={"Good to know!"} variant={"recommendation"}>
    The <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> syntax, which allows our robot to stay put and go to the parent folder
    respectively, also works in root-relative URLs!

    I don't think you ever need it in a real use case though. üòÖ

## Absolute URL

Here's the structure of a basic absolute URL with 3 parts. Hover over each part to see what it does!

<AbsoluteURLDemo/>

## Comparisons

Absolute URLs is necessary for any resources that our own website does not have, and needs to be fetched from other
websites.

However, using it to access stuff on your own website is a foot-gun. An absolute URL requires an unchanging
base part to work consistently (which starts at the beginning of the URL and ends at the green part). Imagine having
to repeat that part over and over again, dozens to hundreds of times, in your URLs. ü•µ

This base part will also change a LOT, which makes the matter much worse.
For example, when we code on our machine, this base part can be <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> or
<code>http://localhost:63342/</code>. When the code is run on your server, this base part will become something like
<code>https://recipes.example.com/</code>. There's no way a sign can points to several different locations on the road!

A root-relative URL can redirect to the correct resource no matter what server you're running the code on, and is much
more concise than an absolute URL.

How about non root-relative URLs? There are 3 reasons we should never use it in HTML:

- A root-relative URL communicates what it's doing better than a non-root-relative URL! Here's a good example.
    ```
    // Assuming that we're in /recipes/index.html

    ice-cream/index.html ‚ùå // We'll have to rely on the URL on the top bar to know what it's doing.
    /recipes/ice-cream/index.html ‚úÖ // The URL is pointing to an ice-cream recipe without us having to look at the URL.
    ```
- If you relocate your HTML file somewhere else, you'll have to fix all the URLs of every link and resource in that file.
- There's a big browser quirk - 2 URLs that are almost identical, one of which has a trailing slash while the other
doesn't, has different <ColorEmphasis>working directories</ColorEmphasis>! This basically makes the relative URL
unreliable. Here's a playground that helps you understand the quirk.
