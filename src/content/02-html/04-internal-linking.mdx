In the previous lessons, we've only talked about and used absolute URLs so far - the ones
that has a <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> at the beginning that can point to your site
or other websites on the interwebz.

This type of URL is necessary for any resources that our own website does not have! However, an absolute URL requires
an unchanging base part to work consistently (like <code>https://recipe.example.com/</code>, which is how a website
distinguishes itself from others)

When it comes to linking to our own stuff though, depending on where our code runs, this base part will change - a LOT.
For example, when we code on our machine, this base part can be <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> or
<code>http://localhost:63342/</code>. When the code is run on your server, this base part will become something like
<code>https://recipes.example.com/</code>. There's no way a sign can points to several different locations on the road!

Fortunately, we can use a relative URL to solve this woe!


## Relative URL

How is a relative URL different from an absolute URL?

Compared to an absolute URL, a relative URL does not have any base part, and it can only point to a
resource on your *own* website - be it another page, a script, an image, or something else. On the upside though,
you don't need to care about what the base URL is

There are 2 kinds of relative URL - a root-relative URL and a non-root-relative URL.
