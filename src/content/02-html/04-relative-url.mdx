In the previous lessons, we've only talked about and used absolute URLs so far - the ones
that has a <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> at the beginning that can point to your site
or other websites on the interwebz.

This type of URL is necessary for any resources that our own website does not have! However, an absolute URL requires
an unchanging base part to work consistently (like <code>https://recipe.example.com/</code>, which is how a website
distinguishes itself from others)

When it comes to linking to our own stuff though, depending on where our code runs, this base part will change - a LOT.
For example, when we code on our machine, this base part can be <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> or
<code>http://localhost:63342/</code>. When the code is run on your server, this base part will become something like
<code>https://recipes.example.com/</code>. There's no way a sign can points to several different locations on the road!
ðŸ˜…

Fortunately, we can use a relative URL to solve this woe!


## Relative URL

How is a relative URL different from an absolute URL?

Compared to an absolute URL, a relative URL does not have any base part, and it can only point to a
resource on your *own* website - be it another page, a script, an image, or something else. On the upside though,
you don't need to care about what the base URL is.

There are 2 kinds of relative URL - a root-relative URL and a non-root-relative URL.


### Root-relative URL

A root-relative URL always starts with a forward slash! This tells the server to start searching from the top-most
folder that *the server knows*, called the <ColorEmphasis>*root folder*</ColorEmphasis>.

Let's understand how a root-relative URL works first!

<PathSimulator/>

In this demo, the *root folder* is the folder whose name is <code>/</code>, and contains files like
<code>terms.html</code> and some folders like <code>assets</code> and <code>recipes</code>.

If you type in <code>/</code> in the input box at the bottom of the demo, you'll see the root folder turn cyan.
Similarly, if the server finds a file or directory with the path you enter, that file or directory
glow <ColorEmphasis color="cyan">*light cyan*</ColorEmphasis>.

If you want to access a file or a folder inside the root folder, you only need to include the folder name after the
forward slash. Here are 2 examples that you can feed into the demo:
```
/terms.html
/recipes
```

If you want to get to the <code>ice-cream</code> folder, you can go to the <code>recipes</code> folder, then
the <code>ice-cream</code> folder inside. Between each folder, there should be a forward slash, acting as a
separator! You can try this URL:
```
/recipes/ice-cream
```

Note that in this demo, folders that you've traversed through but don't match will turn <ColorEmphasis color="lime">*light
green*</ColorEmphasis> - these hints help you track your position in the file tree!


If you want to get to the <code>apple.jpg</code> file, you can go to the <code>assets</code> folder, then
the <code>recipes</code> folder inside, and finally reach the <code>apple.jpg</code> file.
Here's the URL that you can feed into the demo:
```
/assets/recipes/apple.jpg
```

Now we've learned the basics of a root-relative URL, you should try to turn every
file <ColorEmphasis color="cyan">*cyan*</ColorEmphasis> at least once using the
input box in the demo component!

### Non-root-relative URL
